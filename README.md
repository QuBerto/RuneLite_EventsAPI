# EventsAPI Plugin for RuneLite
## by Morgan Van V.

#### NOTE: This plugin was heavily inspired by the OSRSEvents Plugin by llamaXc
####    repo: https://github.com/llamaXc/osrs-events
####    This plugin is simply building off and adapting their foundation for my uses, so credit to them    

The simple goal of this plugin is to be able to have a customizable amount of information that is POSTed from the
RuneLite client to a customizable API endpoint for the purpose of social progress tracking, efficiency analysis,
general logging, as potentially even tournament purposes.

More information will come on the README in the future as this project becomes more defined in scope and purpose
