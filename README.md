# **EventsAPI Plugin for RuneLite** 
### _by Morgan Van V._

**NOTE: This plugin was heavily inspired by the OSRSEvents Plugin by llamaXc [(REPO)]("https://github.com/llamaXc/osrs-events")**

EventsAPI simply builds off and adapts their foundation for my uses, so credit to llamaXc as well as all of their contributors

# Use Cases / Goals
The simple goal of this plugin is to be able to have a customizable amount of information that is POSTed from the
RuneLite client to a custom API endpoint for the purpose of social progress tracking, efficiency analysis,
general logging, as potentially even tournament purposes.

More information will come on the README in the future as this project becomes more defined in scope and purpose

### Future Features / Potential Use Cases

- Blog style webpage that shows a live status of your character (location, skills, etc.)
- Tracking progress similar to CrystalMathLabs, but done locally for the enterprising developer / data scientist (me)
- Efficiency Analysis of training methods through logged events
